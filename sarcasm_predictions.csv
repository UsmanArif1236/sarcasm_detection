amazon on the other hand designed their system with offline playback in mind so it was not really an added feature so much as an activated feature for them the infrastructure was there to begin with

plus they took a lot of their free shipping items and made them socalled add on items where you dont get free shipping unless you include them in an order that goes over 25 what royally pisses me off about that is that the other day i tried to buy a 5 add on item that i needed and i was not even allowed to buy it and pay shipping  it literally blocked me from ordering it at all unless i had 25 worth of stuff already in the cart

gtits not a silly workaround to have internet access everywhere you go this is where we are headed and its not some time of bandaid its not working around a problem

i have internet access its called a cellular phone netflix and youtube and virtually other streaming app works fine with it amazon instant doesnt 

so yes having to bring a tablet along or preload a movie that i might want to watch during what might be downtime is a very silly workaround you can say it isnt but that doesnt make it any less true 


gtthe silly workaround is offline playback there will be no need for offline playback when there is essentially no offline

ok tell me all about something you obviously dont know anything about prior to today the workaround was done through tethering to trick the app into thinking you are on wifi and not data now we have a second method which is even more worthless because you dont even get the content you want on demand ‡≤†_‡≤†",tooterfish_popkin,1441157430,t5_2qh6e,t3_3j85l3,t1_cunnszh,1,cunoco9,television,0

im not going to buy n1 services just to get one show  and really its the shows i want i couldnt care less about whether its netflix amazon or diddlytwat streaming services its the shows that i want to watch

content makers are going to have to sell their stuff on all of these platforms if they want to get to their audience

at the moment we share a netflix account but i would like to see fear the walking dead  which in the uk is exclusive to bt and maybe the alternative top gear which is exclusive to amazon

im not going to pay for 3 services especially not on top of a broadbandcable tv package

the most logical solution for audience members is to torrent the shows that arent shown on whichever streaming service they pay for at which point a feature like offline viewing for some of our content but not all is not really a feature at all its just a ridiculous thing to have stopped you doing in the first place only to add back as though its an innovation

so really the service that wins will be the service that gets the content without seeking out exclusives  cf steam thinking about ways of screwing the audience for a show unless they pay you just makes your service suck right now netflix et al are just trying to make their services suck in a desperate attempt to gain market share from their rivals at the expense of their customers who really just want a good value streaming service that has all the shows they want to watch",[deleted],1441197646,t5_2qh6e,t3_3j85l3,t1_cunmmev,1,cuo2ahi,television,0
